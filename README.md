I started in the techinical space about 3.5 years ago where I worked as an EOL tester for EV batteries for Proterra, since then I moved into a more technical role with Latitude AI where I maintain autonomous vehicles, by installing the hardware techinology and software OS updates, calibrations and configurations on the test vehicles for Ford Motor company.

Objective

My journey working in the AI spectrum has lead me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, in specfic Offensive Security (ethical hacking).

Tools
1. Nmap (Network Mapper)
Purpose: Network discovery and vulnerability scanning.
Usage: Nmap is used to discover hosts and services on a computer network, thus creating a network map. It can be used for port scanning, OS fingerprinting, and service version detection.
Features:
Port scanning
OS detection
Version detection
Network inventory
Scriptable (Nmap Scripting Engine)
2. Metasploit
Purpose: Exploit development and delivery framework.
Usage: Metasploit is an advanced framework for creating, testing, and executing exploits. It comes with a massive database of pre-built exploits and payloads.
Features:
Automatic exploitation of known vulnerabilities
Post-exploitation tools (privilege escalation, data collection)
Payload generation and listener support
Extensive exploit database
Support for various platforms and protocols



Network
1. TryHackMe
Purpose: An online platform that offers guided penetration testing courses, challenges, and virtual environments.
Features:
Structured, beginner-to-expert learning path.
Scenarios to simulate different attack vectors like web, network, and Active Directory exploitation.
Hands-on practice with interactive environments.
Lab environments for practical experience.
